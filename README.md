### Sketch of requirements for visualization (working doc)
* [Visualization requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8WiLrH4ex72GTG7o_q8MVZE2zGCPyv8voxk1IVYZ2U)

**Note:** the structure of this repo was simply initalized as it is now.  Improvements and structural enhancements/shifts as the project progresses are welcomed!

**Note:** This is the current viz repo which was formerly [here](https://github.com/brooksandrew/arc_smoke_alarm).

### Visualizations
* [esri-leaflet-test.html](esri-leaflet-test.html) - quick test of the [esri-leaflet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet) plugin using Red Cross ArcGIS Online division, region, and chapter boundary feature layers, plus HFPC home visits. Esri layers are stored as geojson, not tiles, would need to be tiled or significantly simplified to be fast enough, or use local json instead.

For conversations/questions that are awkward to carry out using GitHub issues, send an email to DataKind Red Cross core volunteers Hannah Recht (hrecht2@gmail.com) and Andrew Brooks (andrewbrooksct@gmail.com) and one of us will follow up with you.
